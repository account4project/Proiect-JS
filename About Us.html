			<h3> Evolution </h3>
			<p id ="firstP"> <b> The BlueBeryl Book Club </b> has been around since 2005, when it was inaugurated in the scope of being an opportunity of monthly meet-up between friends. <br>
			Since then, it has gathered a complex history - close to all of the original founders have quit, but the club's popularity has only grown. Today, there are quite <br>
			several subdivisions, and the meetings have become extremely frequent: multiple times a week, across the entirety of NYC, and currently there are talks of <br>
			expanding to other cities as well. </p>
			<h3> Founders </h3>
			<p> <b> Emma </b> (me!), <b> Alex</b>, <b> Khalid</b>, <b> Charlotte</b> and <b> Will </b> are the original founders. All of us have been avid readers since forever, and it has always been a discussion <br>
			subject. In 2007 Alex and Charlotte quit, for they couldn't spare the time anymore due to their busy career lives, and in 2013 Will had to stop coming after <br>
			moving away. Only I and Khalid remain, but it's significantly less gloomy than it sounds - we've had many members offer to help and manage the meetings, <br> 
			trying to find a solution around everyone's busy schedules. </p>
			<h3> Present </h3>
			<p class = "colorful"> Currently, there are 9 individual subgroups, each centered around specific genres and with their own style of discussion and debate. Albeit our taste might differ, <br>
			many of our members share a common love for books. We hold yearly votes for the best book of the year, with the winner of 2019 being <i> The Testaments </i> by Margaret<br> 
			Atwood, and the winner of last year <i> Educated </i> by Tara Westover. Our clubs frequent many places, some of our favourites being <b> The elk</b>,  <b> Little Collins </b> 	&amp; <b> Hi-Collar</b>. <br>
			We have over 70 frequent members and up to 150 less active ones (mostly due to their busy lives). <br>
