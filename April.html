		<h2> 1984 (Nineteen Eighty-Four) </h2>
		<p> The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. <br>
		1984 is still the great modern classic of &quot;negative utopia&quot;—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely <br>
		convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its <br>
		admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time. <br> </p>
		<h2> Jordan, an old-time review, has to say the following: </h2> 
		<p> This book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin's We, <br>
		and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face. <br>
		But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right. Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great <br>
		Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an <br>
		authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, <br>
		the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their &quot;alternative facts&quot; was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word  <br>
		for truth. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever. <br>
		Orwell’s vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. <br>
		No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control. <br>
		Here, in the USA, in 2019, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they’re stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying <br>
		they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much <br>
		chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when <br>
		we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance <br>
		engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone. <br>
		Which reminds me...one of the things we should never do is brood about the enemy’s ideology (Is Steve Bannon a Fascist? A Nazi? A Stalinist?), for while we try to discern <br>
		his &quot;ideological goals,&quot; the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel. <br>
		Finally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a <br>
		brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of 	&quot;Big Brother&quot; may be, the goal is always the same: <br>
		A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, <br>
		fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face. <br> </p>
